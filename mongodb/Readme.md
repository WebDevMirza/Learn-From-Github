# About MongoDB

MongoDB is a popular open-source **document-oriented database** system that uses a flexible, JSON-like format to store data in collections of documents. It is designed to be scalable, high-performance, and easy to use, making it a popular choice for developers building modern web and mobile applications.

MongoDB is a **backend technology**, specifically a database management system, that is used to store and manage data for web and mobile applications. It is typically accessed and manipulated using a backend programming language such as Node.js, Express.js, PHP, or Python etc. Its primary role is to handle the storage and retrieval of data on the server-side, making it a backend technology.
